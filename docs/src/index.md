# Jevo.jl

Documentation for Jevo.jl, a julia package for distributed, high-performance (co-)evolutionary computation, inspired by [CoEvo](https://github.com/twillkens/coevo). While Jevo is flexible enough to support most evolutionary/co-evolutionary algorithms and organisms, it is designed specifically for distributed deep neuroevolution. Only one selection method has been implemented so far. 

We highly recommend reviewing [Overview](@ref) for a high-level introduction to the package's core concepts, functionality, and design.
